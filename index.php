<h3>Appetizer</h3>

A hors d oeuvre, appetizer or starter is a small dish served before a meal. Some hors d oeuvres are served cold, others hot. Hors d oeuvres may be served at the dinner table as a part of the meal, or they may be served before seating.

<h3>Dessert</h3>
<p>
Dessert is a confectionery course that concludes a main meal.
The course usually consists of sweet foods, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items.
The term "dessert" can apply to many confections, such as cakes, tarts, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, custards, and sweet soups.
Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.
Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.
