<h3>Asia</h3>
<p>
    Asian cuisine includes several major regional cuisines: East Asian, Southeast Asian, 
South Asian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern/Western Asian.  A cuisine is a characteristic 
style of cooking practices and traditions usually associated with a specific culture. 
Asia, being the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, 
many of which have their own characteristic cuisine.

<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>
    European cuisine, or alternatively Western cuisine, is a generalised term collectively referring 
to the cuisines of Europe and other Western countries, including (depending on the definition) that of Russia, 
as well as non-indigenous cuisines of Australasia, the Americas, Southern Africa, and Oceania, 
which derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. 
The term is used by East Asians to contrast with Asian styles of cooking. 
When used by Westerners, the term may sometimes refer more specifically to cuisine in Europe; 
in this context, a synonym is Continental cuisine, especially in British English.

<h3>Canada</h3>
<p>
    Canadian cuisine varies widely depending on the regions of the nation. 
The three earliest cuisines of Canada have First Nations, English, Scottish and French roots, 
with the traditional cuisine of English Canada closely related to British cuisine, 
while the traditional cuisine of French Canada has evolved from French cuisine and 
the winter provisions of fur traders. With subsequent waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th century from Central, 
Southern, and Eastern Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and the Caribbean, the regional cuisines were subsequently augmented.
